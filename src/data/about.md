# Intro

A progressive web developer with 3+ years of front end and back end experience. As a graduate of The
Iron Yard Houston, I am proficient in javascript; structuring and developing responsive web apps. Also highly
skilled in back end development tasks such as 3rd party API implementation, NoSQL databases, and RESTful
APIs. I am seeking to apply my knowledge and further my career by obtaining a position that offers opportunities
for professional growth and achievement. My management background makes me a great team member and the
ability to give or take constructive advice, depending on the needs of any given project.

# Currently
